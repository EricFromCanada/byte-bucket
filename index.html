	<dd>Makes navigation links with drop-down menus usable on iOS by only enabling
		the link if its submenu is visible. This is only required if JavaScript is
		used to hide and show submenus, since iOS accounts for CSS-based menus by
		preventing a :hover region's links from activating until any divs it'll
		reveal are displayed.<br>
